#Steam Game Installer
=====================

## Install games in bulk
######A little macro program that allows you to install all your games

I made this script after doing a new install of steam and finding that every single one of my games that I had copied over said they were uninstalled. The script goes through the installing process, either doing a full install of games you have never downloaded, or a rediscovery of files for games that have been downloaded. It took it roughly 12 hours to go through my 450 games, which may seem like a long time, but almost all of it was spent waiting on steam.

I built this off of Colingg's SteamBulkKeyActivator script. A updated version of his script that currently works with steam is also avaible at following link (https://github.com/linspatz/SteamGameInstaller/releases)

##VAC anti-cheat concerns
This is a script that uses Autohotkey to emulate keyboard and mouse, no reasons to be concerned about VAC. ;)

This script is written in AutoHotKey  
http://ahkscript.org/
>AutoHotkey (AHK) is a free, open-source macro-creation and automation software for Windows that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a scripting language that was initially aimed at providing keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys, that over time evolved into a full-fledged scripting language. 

This is a script that automates the repetitive task of activating steam keys. as this does not inject anything whatsoever you don't have to worry about VAC.
